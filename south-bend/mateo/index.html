    <h1 id="purple">My Personality</h1>
      <h3>I see myself as something of a laid-back person. I can take and give a joke, I try to make friends with everybody, and I can't go through the day without a smile. I also see myself as an honest person, and I try my best at everything.</h3>
      <h1 id="purple">My Tastes<h1>
        <h3>My tastes are kind of normal. In terms of games and TV, I'm more of an action-adventure kind of person. In terms of music, I enjoy mostly rock ("old people music") and a tiny dose of classical and alternative.</h3>

<h1 id="purple">My Favorite Drink</h1>
<h3>My favorite drink is a Peruvian soda called Inca Kola. For those of you who are unfamiliar with it, it is a bubble-gum flavored soda that is utterly repulsive to most people that did not grow up drinking it. I did, however, and I have found that it goes well with Peruvian roasted chicken.</h3>

<h1 id="purple">My Favorite Food</h1>
<h3>My favorite food is fried chicken. I love it because it is chicken and it is fried. I also enjoy enjoy fried chicken because it often comes with sides like collard greens and mashed potatoes.</h3>
