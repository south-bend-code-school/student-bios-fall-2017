<h1>What I love:</h1>
<h2><p> I am very passionate about art. I have a critical eye for artistic value. I create art, specifically sketches, and work around 20-30 minutes on each piece. I post my creations and store them for future viewing. Also on a side note, I critisize my creations very harshly because I want to be truthful to myself and make sure I do my best!(No Slacking!!!)</p></h2>

<h1>What I Value:</h1>
<h2><p> I value artistic, working, and problem-solving skills. I relly admire people with any and/or all of these skills. I really LOVE art(as seen in my previous statements), I admire the fact that some people can just power through a project and make it incredible, and lastly I admire the fact that some people can be presented with the hardest of probelms and solve said problem with detailed logical steps! </p></h2>

<h1>Hobbies I am Great at:</h1>
<h2><p> As previously stated, I am, in my honest oppinion, GREAT at drawing! I LOVE it!! In my spare time, if I'm not working on a project, I'm furiously planning for my next piece. Other than that, I am pretty good at working. When I work, I intend to do as much as posssible as fast as possible!</p></h2>

<h1>Issues I Care About:</h1>
<p><h2>Very recntly, my eyes have been opened to the damage we humans have done to ourselves and the environment we live in. Last summer I attended the Bowman Creek Educational Ecosystem program here in South Bend. During that time, I have learned about so many ways that we have hurt ourselves and the environment, that were thought to be irreversable. But I also learned about the new ways we have found to heal ourselves and the environment, using thetechnology we have worked so hard to make! I now intend to strive to do my part for as long as i have the ability to!</p></h2>

<h1>My Future with Technology:</h1>
<p><h2> My dream career is to be a mechanical engineer, in which will use a LOT of diffent designing tech. I will have to master how to use many different programs before I even step close to a degree.  My daliy job may have to use these programs and skills to design, digitally build, and digitally test many projects. If I am lucky, I will get some sort of...starting job at the Bowman Creek Educational Ecosystem program. This job, and many others, will have me work with arduinos, computer coding, etc! This will be quite the challenge, but I intend to go all the way!</p></h2>
