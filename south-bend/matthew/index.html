<h2> This is where i live </h2>

<h2> If you haven't noticed already, I highly value the internet. I live on a daily intake of memes from any source and it fuels my ego. These intakes tend to become part of my daily routine and leave an impression on my friends and classmates. So if you wanna stay innocent, stay clear from me. :P </h2>

<h2> I also own a lake house! For years I've been inner tubing and just recently I've learned to water ski!! We often invite friends and family up to have a great time, so the water has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember. </h2>

<h2> Another thing that has been important to me in recent years is band. I play the euphonium (which for those who don't know is basically a smaller tuba), and I can't explain how amazing it feels to express myself through my instrument during spring and autumn nights!! Anyways, it has been a very big part of who I am for at least 4 years. </h2>

<h2> Adding on to that, the most recent addition to my life, which was in the past year, has been track. This was one, my most dificult extra curriculur activity, and two, one of the most fun. It should beself explanatory, but in track, you run a determined distance, but don't be underwhelmed, it is really hard!! Anyways, I am a 400m and 800m runner, but that could change! </h2>

<h1> <p> Now that I've explained mostly everything to know about myself, I can move on to my experience with coding! I have done many miscellaneous camps and clubs focusing on learning basic coding, but those have either been Tynker learning software or very short camps. But ever since I was very young, I have wanted to create video games. And nothing has stood in my way of that dream. So one day my parents and I discovered South Bend Code School, where I joined and for the past while, have been learning to code in html, javascript, and more!! I might not be very good yet, but I am very confident that with the help of this coding school, I will be able to advance in my coding experience for years to come!!! <p> </h1>
